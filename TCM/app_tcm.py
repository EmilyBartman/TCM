    st.markdown("""
    In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the tongue is seen as a mirror to the body‚Äôs internal state. Its color, shape, moisture, coating, and movement all provide clues about organ function and systemic imbalances.

    **What the tongue reveals:**
    - **Tongue Body Color**: Reflects blood, Qi, and organ health
    - **Tongue Shape**: Can indicate excess or deficiency syndromes
    - **Tongue Coating**: Suggests digestive heat, cold, or dampness
    - **Moisture Level**: Linked to fluid metabolism and Yin/Yang balance
    - **Tongue Movement**: Trembling or deviation may signal wind or weakness

    Western medicine may not commonly use tongue inspection diagnostically, but it does correlate with:
    - Anemia (pale tongue)
    - Dehydration (dry tongue)
    - Oral candidiasis (thick white coating)
    - Circulatory issues (bluish-purple tongue)

    Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Western medicine differ in philosophy and methods but can be complementary:

    | Concept | TCM Interpretation | Western Medicine Analogy |
    |--------|---------------------|---------------------------|
    | Qi (Vital Energy) | Flow of life energy through meridians | Nervous & Circulatory System activity |
    | Yin/Yang | Balance of cold/hot, passive/active forces | Homeostasis (e.g., hormonal balance) |
    | Tongue Diagnosis | Reflects internal organ status | Inflammation markers, dehydration, anemia |
    | Syndrome Differentiation | Pattern-based holistic assessment | Evidence-based diagnosis (labs, scans) |

    Integrative medicine combines both paradigms to enhance wellness, prevention, and personalized care.
